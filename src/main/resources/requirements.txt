Create a  sample spring boot program with below points

 Kafka Producer → Consumer Flow
 Client
Sends HTTP request
Uses Postman / Frontend / Curl
 REST API (Producer)
Exposes endpoint (e.g. POST /produce)
Validates request data
Converts data to message
Publishes message to Kafka topic
 Kafka Topic
Acts as message queue
Stores messages temporarily
Decouples producer and consumer
Supports high throughput
 Consumer
Subscribes to Kafka topic
Reads messages asynchronously
Processes message
Handles failures / retries
 Log / Database
Logs processed message
Saves data to DB



 End-to-End Flow
Client → sends request
Producer → sends event
Kafka → stores event
Consumer → processes event
DB/Log → persists result
